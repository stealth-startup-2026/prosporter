# Accessibility — storefront shopping flow (CLNT-171)

Scope of this pass: the cart drawer (including the new discount-code entry),
shop filters and listing, the product card and the product detail page, plus the
shared focus styles in `src/app/globals.css`. A follow-up pass added the skip
link, gave the mobile menu the same modal treatment, and moved the shared
modal-dialog behaviour into one hook. The search dialog is still owned
elsewhere and is listed under "Still to do".

Target: **WCAG 2.2 level AA**.

---

## What changed, per component

### `src/components/cart/CartDrawer.tsx`

- The panel is a real modal dialog: `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`,
  `aria-labelledby` pointing at the "Your Bag" heading (`#cart-drawer-title`).
- **Focus in**: opening the drawer moves focus to the panel itself
  (`tabIndex={-1}`), so a screen reader announces the dialog name first.
- **Focus return**: the element that was focused when the drawer opened (the
  header bag button) is stored in `openerRef` and re-focused by the effect's
  cleanup when the drawer closes — whether it closed via Escape, the close
  button, the scrim or "Continue shopping".
- **Focus trap**: a capture-phase `keydown` listener wraps Tab / Shift+Tab
  inside the panel and pulls focus back if it escapes.
- **Escape** closes the drawer.
- **Background**: every sibling of the drawer root gets the `inert` attribute
  while it is open (removed on close), so the header, page and footer are out of
  the tab order and hidden from assistive tech. When the drawer is closed the
  root itself is `inert`, so the off-canvas controls are never tab stops.
- **Live region**: a single always-mounted `role="status" aria-live="polite"`
  node announces bag state ("2 items in your bag. Subtotal $180.00.") and any
  cart error. The visible error paragraph is `aria-hidden` so it is not read
  twice.
- **Accessible names**: quantity buttons read "Increase quantity of Ace Unisex
  Tee (Green · M)"; remove reads "Remove Ace Unisex Tee (Green · M) from bag".
  Line thumbnails are `alt=""` because the product title sits next to them.
- **Checkout** is a real `<a href>`; when no checkout URL exists yet the
  placeholder is a non-focusable `span` with `aria-disabled`.
- The free-shipping bar is a labelled `role="progressbar"`; the line list is a
  `<ul>` with `aria-label` and `aria-busy` while a mutation is in flight.

#### Discount code entry (`DiscountCode` in the same file)

- A disclosure: a real `<button>` with `aria-expanded` / `aria-controls`, so
  Tab + Enter/Space operate it with no key handling of our own. The panel is
  toggled with `hidden` rather than unmounted, which keeps the drawer's focus
  trap correct (it skips controls with no layout box).
- The field is a `<form>` with one labelled `<input>` (sr-only `<label for>`),
  so Enter submits. Apply is `disabled` + `aria-disabled` when the field is
  empty or a mutation is in flight, and carries `aria-busy` while pending.
- Failures come back from `applyDiscountCode` as a plain string. They render
  inline under the field (`aria-hidden`) and are announced once through a
  single always-mounted `role="status" aria-live="polite"` node, which also
  carries the "Discount code SUMMER20 applied." confirmation. The input gets
  `aria-invalid` and `aria-describedby` pointing at that node.
- Each applied code is a chip in a labelled `<ul>` with a 24px remove button
  named "Remove discount code SUMMER20" (removing applies the empty string,
  which is how the server action clears codes). The chip sits above the
  disclosure, so it stays visible when the disclosure is collapsed.
- The whole thing lives inside the drawer panel, so it is inside the existing
  focus trap.
- Totals: when Shopify returns a cart-level allocation the footer shows
  Subtotal → Discount (−$18.00, with an sr-only "minus" so the glyph is read)
  → Total. The maths is in `src/lib/cart-totals.ts` (pure, unit-tested in
  `src/lib/__tests__/cart-totals.test.mjs`).

### `src/components/cart/CartProvider.tsx`

The public `useCart()` API gained `discount`, `total`, `discountCodes` and
`errorSource`. The single error slot is now tagged with the surface that should
render it ("cart" or "discount"), so the discount form can show its failure
inline without a second piece of state; the drawer's banner and live region only
show cart-sourced errors. Pending state is still the one shared `isPending`
transition. The opener/last-focused element is tracked by the modal hook.

### `src/lib/hooks/useModalDialog.ts` (new)

The modal-dialog behaviour the cart drawer, the mobile filter sheet and the
mobile menu had each grown separately: remember the opener, focus the panel,
trap Tab / Shift+Tab, close on Escape, lock body scroll, optionally mark every
sibling of the dialog root `inert`, and undo all of it (focus back to the
opener) on close. All three now call the hook. The markup contract —
`role="dialog"`, `aria-modal`, `aria-labelledby`, `tabIndex={-1}` on the panel,
`inert` on the off-canvas root — stays with each component.

Behaviour is unchanged in the two that already had it, with one deliberate
tightening: the filter sheet's Tab list now skips controls with no layout box
(inside a collapsed filter group), which were never tabbable anyway. The filter
sheet still does not inert its background — its root's siblings are page
sections, not the header — so that is left as it was.

### `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`

- The mobile menu is now a real modal dialog, matching the cart drawer:
  `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`, `aria-labelledby` on a real `<h2>`
  "Menu" (was a `<span>`), focus into the panel, Tab trapped, Escape closes,
  body scroll locked, every sibling `inert` while open, and focus returned to
  the hamburger however it closed (Escape, the close button, the scrim, or
  following a link).
- The off-canvas root is `inert` when closed instead of `aria-hidden`, so its
  links are no longer tab stops behind the page.
- The hamburger has `aria-expanded` / `aria-controls` pointing at the panel.
- Both navs have accessible names: "Primary" and "Mobile".

### `src/app/layout.tsx`

"Skip to content" is the first focusable element in the `<body>`, targeting the
one `<main id="main" tabIndex={-1}>` landmark, so activating it moves real focus
rather than only the scroll position. `scroll-mt-24` keeps the landing point
clear of the sticky header (2.4.11).

### `src/components/cart/AddToCartButton.tsx`

`aria-busy` while the server action is pending, `aria-disabled` alongside the
real `disabled`, and an explicit `focus-visible` ring in the default class
string (the button is ink-on-ink, so it needs its own offset outline).

### `src/components/shop/Filters.tsx`

- Every filter group is a `<fieldset>` with a `<legend>`; the collapse control
  lives in the legend with `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` pointing at the
  panel, which is toggled with `hidden` rather than being unmounted.
- Availability, gender and surface rows were already checkboxes; the input now
  precedes the styled box so the visual box can mirror focus through Tailwind
  `peer-focus-visible:` variants.
- Colour swatches and size chips were `aria-pressed` buttons; they are now real
  `<input type="checkbox">` controls behind visually hidden labels, so they
  participate in the group, expose checked state and are keyboard operable with
  Space. Colour swatches carry an sr-only name ("Green (12 products)") because
  the colour alone is not a text alternative.
- The price slider has a real `<label>` (sr-only) and `aria-valuetext` so the
  value is announced as a formatted price, not a bare number.

### `src/components/shop/Listing.tsx`

- The product grid is a `<ul>` / `<li>` list; each card is one list item.
- The page's single `<h1>` stays in `src/app/shop/[[...segments]]/page.tsx`; the
  listing adds an sr-only `<h2>` "Products" that labels the results `<section>`,
  and the sidebar `<h2>` "Filters" labels the sidebar.
- The results count is `role="status" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"`, so
  changing a filter or sort announces "12 products".
- The sort `<select>` has a visible-to-AT `<label for>` instead of `aria-label`.
- Applied-filter chips are a labelled list; each remove button reads "Remove
  filter: Size M" (the chip text itself is `aria-hidden` so it is not doubled).
- The mobile Filters button has `aria-expanded` / `aria-controls`, and the
  bottom sheet is a modal dialog with the same treatment as the cart drawer:
  focus in, Tab trapped, Escape closes, focus returns to the Filters button,
  `inert` when closed.

### `src/components/product/ProductCard.tsx`

- One link per card. Previously the whole card was a `<Link>` with a `<button>`
  nested inside it (invalid HTML, two overlapping activations). Now the card is
  a positioned `<div>`, the product title link stretches over the card with an
  `::after` overlay, and the quick-add button sits above the overlay as an
  independent, second control.
- The link's accessible name is the product name. The card image is `alt=""`
  (decorative — the title is right there), so the product is announced once.
- Quick add reads "Quick add Ace Unisex Tee to bag".
- The price appears once. Colour dots are `aria-hidden` with an sr-only
  "4 colours available" summary.
- The focus ring is drawn on the stretched overlay, so keyboard focus outlines
  the whole card rather than one line of text.

### `src/components/product/ProductDetail.tsx`

- Variant picker is a radio group per option: `<fieldset>` + sr-only `<legend>`
  (the visible option heading is `aria-hidden` to avoid a double announcement),
  with visually hidden `<input type="radio">` inputs behind styled labels. One
  tab stop per option, arrow keys move between values, Space selects.
- **Sold-out values** are computed from the variant list and announced with an
  sr-only "(sold out)"; non-swatch chips also show it visually (struck through),
  swatches dim.
- A `role="status" aria-live="polite"` region announces the selected variant's
  price and availability whenever the selection changes.
- Gallery thumbnails are buttons in a labelled list, named "Show image 2 of 4:
  <alt text>", with `aria-pressed` / `aria-current` for the active one. The
  large hero image keeps the real alt text; thumbnails' inner images are
  `alt=""` because the button already carries the name.
- Accordions: `aria-expanded` + `aria-controls`, panels are
  `role="region" aria-labelledby` the button and are hidden with `hidden`, so
  the store-authored description HTML lives in a labelled, reachable region.
  Each accordion header is wrapped in an `<h2>` under the page `<h1>`.
- "Add to bag" gets `aria-busy`, `aria-disabled`, and `aria-describedby`
  pointing at the "choose a size" error (which is `role="alert"`).
- The struck-through compare-at price is prefixed with an sr-only "Was".

### `src/app/globals.css`

- `:focus-visible` keeps the 2px `--color-green-deep` outline (9.4:1 on paper,
  3.4:1 on `--color-surface`) and now adds a 2px paper-coloured halo in the
  outline gap, so the ring is still visible against ink-dark controls
  (Add to bag, Checkout, selected size chips).
- `.skip-link`: fixed top-left, translated off-screen until `:focus`, drawn
  with the ink/paper tokens so it matches the primary buttons. `#main:focus`
  drops the ring for the pointer path and uses an inset ring for the keyboard
  path, instead of outlining the whole page.
- Explicit `.sr-only` definition mirroring Tailwind's utility, since several
  components depend on it for real form inputs.
- `[inert] { pointer-events: none; user-select: none }` as belt-and-braces for
  the background behind an open modal.
- The existing `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` block already neutralises every
  transition touched in this pass (drawer slide, sheet slide, chevron rotation,
  card zoom).

## Still to do

**Done since this doc was first written** (was "owned by the header/nav/search
agent"): the skip link, the mobile menu as a modal dialog, `aria-expanded` /
`aria-controls` on the hamburger, accessible names on both navs, and the bag
button's count-bearing name. What is left of that list:

- Primary nav dropdowns (none exist yet) would need keyboard operation and
  Escape to dismiss (1.4.13).
- The search dialog still needs a labelled combobox, `aria-controls` on the
  listbox, `aria-activedescendant` for arrow-key navigation, a live region
  announcing result counts, and focus return to the search trigger on close.
  `src/components/search/SearchDialog.tsx` does not yet use
  `useModalDialog`; moving it over is the obvious next step.
- `scroll-margin-top` is set on `#main` only. Focusable elements deep in a page
  can still land under the sticky header when scrolled to (2.4.11).

**Not covered anywhere yet:**

- **Contrast of `--color-subtle` (#8c9286): 3.2:1 on paper, 2.9:1 on
  `--color-surface`.** The token is unchanged — this is a pending design
  decision; #6b7266 would reach 4.97:1 on paper and 4.51:1 on surface. Every
  place it is currently used for text that must meet 1.4.3 (4.5:1) is listed
  under "Subtle-text contrast audit" below.
- Product description HTML comes from Shopify; heading levels and image alt text
  inside it are the merchandiser's responsibility. Worth a content guideline.
- No automated axe run in CI.
- Zoom / reflow (1.4.10) at 320px and 400% has not been verified.
- Forms outside the shopping flow (newsletter, contact) were not in scope.

## Subtle-text contrast audit (1.4.3, pending a design decision)

Every current use of `text-subtle` for text that must meet 4.5:1. Nothing here
was changed except the one line noted at the end; the fix is either darkening
the token or switching these call sites to `--color-muted` (#5b6157, 6.4:1 on
paper).

| File | Line(s) | Text |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/components/cart/CartDrawer.tsx` | 357, 392, 453 | "Out of stock", the "Remove" line button, "Secure checkout powered by Shopify" |
| `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` | 181, 191, 196, 210 | Mobile-menu section eyebrows ("Shop", "Collections", "Clubs & Teams") and the per-category product counts |
| `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx` | 52, 68 | Footer column headings, the legal / copyright line |
| `src/components/shop/Filters.tsx` | 109 | Facet counts next to each filter row |
| `src/components/product/ProductCard.tsx` | 95, 122 | Category eyebrow, the "+N" colour overflow badge |
| `src/components/product/ProductDetail.tsx` | 176, 185, 239, 290 | Category eyebrow, the struck-through compare-at price, the selected option value, sold-out size chips |
| `src/components/search/SearchDialog.tsx` | 108 | Search input placeholder |
| `src/app/search/page.tsx` | 50, 72, 84, 126 | Breadcrumb, the search field's visible label, its placeholder, the "Sort" label |
| `src/app/shop/[[...segments]]/page.tsx` | 72 | Breadcrumb |
| `src/app/product/[slug]/page.tsx` | 86 | Breadcrumb |
| `src/app/page.tsx` | 76, 122, 151, 174, 205 | Section eyebrows and the "shop the range" link caret |
| `src/app/error.tsx` | 21, 27 | "Something went wrong" eyebrow, the error reference |
| `src/app/not-found.tsx` | 9 | "404" eyebrow |

Exempt: `src/components/product/ProductDetail.tsx:319` is the disabled
Add-to-bag state, and disabled controls are outside 1.4.3.

One line was moved off the token in this pass because it sits directly under the
new discount total and had to be legible: the drawer's "Shipping & taxes
calculated at checkout" is now `text-muted`.

The News & Events pages (`src/app/blog/`, `src/components/news/`) were rebuilt on
`text-muted` for their eyebrow, dates and back link, so they no longer appear in
the table above.

## Manual QA checklist

### Keyboard only (no mouse)

1. **Product card grid** (`/shop/tops`): Tab through the grid. Each card should
   take **two** stops at most — the product title link (ring around the whole
   card) and, where present, the quick-add button. Never a third stop for the
   image.
2. **Quick add**: focus a quick-add button and press Enter. The drawer opens and
   focus lands in it. Press Escape — focus returns to that same quick-add button.
3. **Sort**: Tab to the sort select, change it with arrow keys. A screen reader
   should announce the new product count.
4. **Filters (desktop)**: Tab into the sidebar. Each group header toggles with
   Enter/Space and reports expanded/collapsed. Checkboxes toggle with Space, and
   the styled box shows a focus ring. The price slider moves with arrow keys and
   announces a dollar value.
5. **Filters (mobile, ≤1024px)**: activate "Filters". Focus moves into the
   sheet, Tab cycles inside it only, Escape closes it and focus returns to the
   Filters button.
6. **Filter chips**: after applying filters, Tab to a chip and press Enter — the
   filter is removed and the count is announced.
7. **PDP** (`/product/ace-unisex`): Tab order should be thumbnails → (size guide)
   → each option group (one stop per group; arrow keys change the value) →
   Add to bag → the four accordion headers. Selecting a size should announce the
   price and availability.
8. **Sold-out variants**: pick a product with a sold-out size; the chip is struck
   through and announces "(sold out)".
9. **Cart drawer**: from the PDP press Enter on Add to bag. Focus moves into the
   drawer. Tab: close → −/quantity/+ per line → Remove per line → Checkout, then
   wraps. Shift+Tab wraps backwards. Nothing behind the scrim is reachable.
10. **Drawer close paths**: Escape, the close button, and "Continue shopping"
    each return focus to the control that opened the drawer.
11. **Quantity**: change a quantity; the live region should announce the new item
    count and subtotal once (not per keystroke).

12. **Skip link**: load any page and press Tab once. "Skip to content" appears
    top-left; Enter moves focus into `<main>` and the next Tab lands on the first
    control inside the page, not back in the header.
13. **Discount code**: in the drawer, Tab to "Have a discount code?", press
    Enter. The panel opens, Tab reaches the field and Apply. Type a bad code and
    press Enter — the error is announced once and shown under the field. Apply a
    good one — the chip appears with the discount and total; Tab to the chip's
    remove button and press Enter to clear it.
14. **Mobile menu (≤1024px)**: activate the hamburger. Focus moves into the
    panel, Tab cycles inside it only, nothing behind the scrim is reachable,
    Escape closes it and focus returns to the hamburger. Same for the close
    button, a scrim click and following a link.

### Screen reader spot checks (VoiceOver + Safari, NVDA + Firefox)

- Drawer opens announced as "Your Bag, dialog".
- Filter groups announced as "Colour, group" with "checkbox, not checked".
- Variant options announced as "Size, group … Medium, radio button, 2 of 5".
- Product cards read once: name, price, "4 colours available".
- Mobile menu opens announced as "Menu, dialog".
- Applying a code announces "Discount code SUMMER20 applied." once.

### Visual

- Focus ring is visible on every control, including the ink-dark Add to bag and
  Checkout buttons and the selected (black) size chip.
- Browser zoom to 200%: no clipped focus rings, no horizontal scroll.
- macOS "Reduce motion" on: drawer and sheet appear without sliding.
- Windows High Contrast / forced-colors: selected filters and variants are still
  distinguishable (they rely on `ring`/background, so verify).
