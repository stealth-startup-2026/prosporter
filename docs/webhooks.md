# Shopify webhooks

Catalog reads in `src/lib/shopify/` are cached with `force-cache` plus the tags in
`src/lib/shopify/tags.ts`. Nothing in the storefront polls Shopify, so a price,
title, image or stock change would sit behind a stale cache for up to
`CATALOG_REVALIDATE_SECONDS` (1 hour). Webhooks close that gap: Shopify posts an
event, the receiver revalidates the affected tags, and the next visitor triggers
the refetch.

## Pieces

| Thing | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Receiver (POST) | `src/app/api/webhooks/shopify/route.ts` → `/api/webhooks/shopify` |
| Pure helpers (HMAC, topic → tags) | `src/lib/shopify/webhooks.ts` |
| Unit tests | `src/lib/shopify/__tests__/webhooks.test.mjs` (`npm test`) |
| Registration script | `scripts/webhooks/register_webhooks.py` |
| Cache tags | `src/lib/shopify/tags.ts` |

## HMAC verification with a Dev Dashboard app

The migration app ("ProSporter-migration") is a Shopify Dev Dashboard app
installed on the client's store. Webhook subscriptions it creates are signed
with **the app's client secret** — the same value the migration scripts read as
`SHOPIFY_ADMIN_CLIENT_SECRET`. There is no separate "webhook secret" to generate
and no shared secret in the Shopify admin UI to copy; the Notifications page in
the store admin has its own secret, but that one only applies to webhooks
created there, not to app-owned subscriptions.

So on the storefront host:

```
SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET = <the ProSporter-migration app's client secret>
```

Shopify computes `base64(HMAC-SHA256(raw_request_body, client_secret))` and
sends it as `X-Shopify-Hmac-Sha256`. The receiver recomputes it over the raw
body bytes and compares with `crypto.timingSafeEqual`.

The signature is over the **exact bytes** Shopify sent. `await request.text()`
runs before any parsing, and the body is never re-serialised before verifying —
`JSON.parse` followed by `JSON.stringify` changes whitespace and unicode escapes
and would break every signature.

The storefront holds no Admin API token and must never be given one. The
receiver can only invalidate caches; it cannot read or write store data.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | yes | The app's client secret. Without it the route answers **500** (so Shopify retries) rather than silently accepting or dropping events. |
| `SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_ALLOWED_SHOPS` | no | Comma-separated `*.myshopify.com` domains to accept. When unset, the receiver accepts `ihuvab-u2.myshopify.com`, `prosporter.myshopify.com` and whatever `SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN` is set to. |
| `SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN` | already required | Also feeds the default allow-list. |

The store has two names: the internal domain `ihuvab-u2.myshopify.com` and the
primary `prosporter.myshopify.com`. Shopify sends the internal one in
`X-Shopify-Shop-Domain`, which is why both are accepted by default.

## Topics and revalidation mapping

`topicToTags(topic, payload)` in `src/lib/shopify/webhooks.ts`:

| `X-Shopify-Topic` | Tags revalidated |
| --- | --- |
| `products/create`, `products/update`, `products/delete` | `shopify:products` + `shopify:product:<handle>` when the payload carries a handle |
| `collections/create`, `collections/update`, `collections/delete` | `shopify:collections` + `shopify:collection:<handle>` when present |
| `inventory_levels/update`, `inventory_items/update` | `shopify:inventory` + `shopify:products` (availability renders on product and listing pages) |
| anything else | none; the route logs and answers 200 |

Delete events usually arrive with only an id, so the fine-grained tag is skipped
and the coarse tag does the work.

Revalidation uses `revalidateTag(tag, { expire: 0 })` — the two-argument form
required by Next 16.3, with an inline profile that expires the tagged entries
immediately. The next visit to an affected page refetches from Shopify before
rendering, so an admin edit is visible on the first reload after the webhook
lands. (The `"max"` profile was tried first: it serves the stale copy once and
refreshes in the background, which read as "changes take minutes to show".)
The cost is one slower page load per edit instead of a stale one.

### Waiting for Shopify to catch up

Shopify fires the webhook the instant the admin write commits, but its
Storefront API (and edge cache) can trail that write by a few seconds. Expiring
the cache in that window makes the next visitor refetch the *old* data and
store it for the full hour — measured in production as roughly one edit in three
"never showing up". So the route answers 200 immediately and does the expiry in
`after()`:

1. `consistencyProbe(plan, payload)` picks what to watch: the product or
   collection handle plus the payload's `updated_at`; delete topics wait for the
   resource to disappear; inventory events and payloads without a handle get a
   fixed 4 s delay instead.
2. The route polls the Storefront API uncached every 1.5 s until `isCaughtUp`
   reports an `updatedAt` at or after the webhook's `updated_at`, giving up after
   20 s and expiring anyway (late-but-correct beats never). The probe sends the
   **page's own query** (`GET_PRODUCT_BY_HANDLE` / `GET_COLLECTION_BY_HANDLE`
   with the page's default variables), because Shopify caches Storefront
   responses per query: a slim `{ updatedAt }` probe was seen reporting fresh
   while the page's query still returned the old version.
3. Then it expires the tags. `maxDuration` on the route is 30 s to leave room.

Typical end-to-end latency, admin save → live page: about 1–3 s. Logs:
`shopify.webhook.accepted` on receipt, `shopify.webhook.revalidated` with
`outcome` (`caught_up` / `timeout` / `delayed`), `probes` and `waitedMs` once
the expiry has run, `shopify.webhook.probe_failed` for a failed probe.

## Registering the subscriptions

```bash
python3 scripts/webhooks/register_webhooks.py list                                  # what exists today
python3 scripts/webhooks/register_webhooks.py ensure https://www.prosporter.co.uk   # dry run (default)
python3 scripts/webhooks/register_webhooks.py ensure https://www.prosporter.co.uk --apply
```

`ensure` is idempotent: it creates a subscription per topic when missing,
updates the `uri`/`format` when they drift, leaves correct ones alone, and never
touches a topic outside its managed list. Extra subscriptions on a managed topic
are reported and only removed with `--prune`. `--with-inventory-items` adds
`INVENTORY_ITEMS_UPDATE`, which is off by default because it also fires on
cost/SKU edits; `INVENTORY_LEVELS_UPDATE` already covers stock movement.

Registered topics: `PRODUCTS_CREATE`, `PRODUCTS_UPDATE`, `PRODUCTS_DELETE`,
`COLLECTIONS_CREATE`, `COLLECTIONS_UPDATE`, `COLLECTIONS_DELETE`,
`INVENTORY_LEVELS_UPDATE`. Endpoint: `<BASE_URL>/api/webhooks/shopify`, format
JSON.

### 2026-07 Admin API shapes (introspected against the live store)

`WebhookSubscriptionInput` has fields `format`, `includeFields`, `filter`,
`metafieldNamespaces`, `metafields`, `name`, `uri`. The destination is **`uri`
(a `String`)** — the older `callbackUrl` field and the
`WebhookSubscriptionEndpoint` union are gone.

```graphql
mutation CreateWebhook($topic: WebhookSubscriptionTopic!, $sub: WebhookSubscriptionInput!) {
  webhookSubscriptionCreate(topic: $topic, webhookSubscription: $sub) {
    webhookSubscription { id topic uri format apiVersion { handle } }
    userErrors { field message }
  }
}
# variables: { "topic": "PRODUCTS_UPDATE", "sub": { "uri": "https://…/api/webhooks/shopify", "format": "JSON" } }

mutation UpdateWebhook($id: ID!, $sub: WebhookSubscriptionInput!) { webhookSubscriptionUpdate(id: $id, webhookSubscription: $sub) { … } }
mutation DeleteWebhook($id: ID!) { webhookSubscriptionDelete(id: $id) { deletedWebhookSubscriptionId userErrors { field message } } }
```

`WebhookSubscription.apiVersion` is an `ApiVersion` object, not a scalar; select
`apiVersion { handle }`. `webhookSubscriptions(...)` returns only subscriptions
owned by the calling app — subscriptions created by other apps or by the store's
Notifications page are invisible here and cannot be modified or deleted by this
script.

## Testing locally with a signed curl

Start the app with a throwaway secret:

```bash
SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=test PORT=3113 npm run start
```

Sign a body and post it (the python one-liner prints the base64 digest):

```bash
BODY='{"id":123,"handle":"nago"}'
SIG=$(python3 -c 'import base64,hashlib,hmac,sys;print(base64.b64encode(hmac.new(sys.argv[1].encode(),sys.argv[2].encode(),hashlib.sha256).digest()).decode())' "test" "$BODY")

curl -i -X POST http://localhost:3113/api/webhooks/shopify \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-Shopify-Topic: products/update' \
  -H 'X-Shopify-Shop-Domain: prosporter.myshopify.com' \
  -H 'X-Shopify-Webhook-Id: local-test-1' \
  -H "X-Shopify-Hmac-Sha256: $SIG" \
  --data "$BODY"
```

Expected: `200 {"ok":true,"topic":"products/update","tags":["shopify:products","shopify:product:nago"]}`.
Repeat the same command unchanged and the second call answers
`{"ok":true,"duplicate":true}`. Drop the signature header and it is `401`.

`--data` must be byte-identical to the string that was signed; `--data-binary
@file` is safer for payloads containing newlines.

Note that a local `npm run start` also needs the usual Shopify env (or
`SHOPIFY_OPTIONAL=1`) to boot, and `revalidateTag` only affects that process's
own cache.

## Failure modes

| Symptom | Response | Cause / fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` unset on the host | 500 | Deliberate: Shopify retries for ~48 hours, so events survive a misconfigured deploy. Set the app client secret. |
| Signature mismatch | 401 | Wrong secret (a rotated client secret, or the Notifications-page secret instead of the app's), or a proxy/CDN that rewrote or recompressed the body. |
| Missing `X-Shopify-Hmac-Sha256` | 401 | Not from Shopify. |
| Unrecognised `X-Shopify-Shop-Domain` | 403 | Signature was valid but the shop is not in the allow-list. Add it to `SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_ALLOWED_SHOPS`. |
| Unknown topic | 200, no-op | A subscription exists for a topic the receiver does not map. Harmless; remove the subscription or extend `topicToTags`. |
| Duplicate delivery | 200, `duplicate: true` | Shopify redelivered. Dedupe is a per-process 512-entry / 10-minute LRU keyed on `X-Shopify-Webhook-Id`; it is **best effort only**. Multi-instance and cross-restart dedupe are out of scope — a missed dedupe costs one redundant revalidation, which is harmless because revalidation is idempotent. |
| Handler slower than 5s | Shopify retries | The handler does no network I/O, so this should not happen. Never add a Shopify fetch to it. |
| Product changed but the page is stale | – | Check the subscription exists (`list`), that the URI matches the deployed host, and that the page's fetch actually carries the tag. On a multi-instance host, `revalidateTag` must reach a shared cache handler; with per-instance in-memory caches only the instance that received the webhook is invalidated. |
| App uninstalled / reinstalled | – | Subscriptions are app-owned and disappear with the app. Re-run `ensure --apply`, and re-check `SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` if the client secret changed. |

## Out of scope

- Cross-instance idempotency (needs shared storage such as Redis or KV).
- Order, customer and cart topics: the storefront caches none of that.
- Retry/dead-letter bookkeeping beyond Shopify's own retry schedule.
