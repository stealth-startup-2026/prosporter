/**
 * Response security headers (CLNT-179, defects D5 and D6).
 *
 * `next.config.ts` imports `securityHeaders()` and returns it from `headers()`
 * for every route, so every HTML, JSON and asset response carries the same set.
 * The list lives here rather than inline in the config for one reason: the
 * config also imports `docs/redirects/redirects.json`, which Node cannot load
 * without an import attribute, so a config-level export is not reachable from
 * `node --test`. This module has no imports at all and is covered by
 * `src/lib/__tests__/security-headers.test.mjs`.
 *
 * Nonces are deliberately not used. A per-request nonce has to be minted in
 * `src/proxy.ts` and forces dynamic rendering on every route (see
 * `node_modules/next/dist/docs/01-app/02-guides/content-security-policy.md`);
 * this storefront is almost entirely prerendered and its LCP is already over
 * budget (defect D3), so the policy is static and accepts `'unsafe-inline'`
 * for scripts. See `docs/deployment.md` § Security headers for the rationale
 * per directive and how to extend it.
